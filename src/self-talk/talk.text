Keep small promises to yourself.
Do 1–2 daily non-negotiables (workout, reading, waking up on time). Confidence = self-trust.

Fix your posture immediately.
Stand tall, shoulders back, slow movements. Body language changes mindset fast.

Speak 10% slower.
Calm pace = authority. No rushing. No over-explaining.

Do one uncomfortable thing daily.
Send the message. Start the conversation. Share your idea. Growth = exposure.

Upgrade appearance basics.
Clean shoes, fitted clothes, groomed hair/beard, good hygiene. Details matter.
